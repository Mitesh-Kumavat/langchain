### 🗓️ [Day 9: Text Splitters](./text_splitter/)
- Understanding Text Splitters and their importance
- Split documents on the basis of length, text structure, document structure, semantic meaning etc.
- Using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, `CharacterTextSplitter`, etc.

### 🗓️ [Day 10: Vector Stores](./vector_stores/)
- Understanding Vector Stores and their role in LangChain
